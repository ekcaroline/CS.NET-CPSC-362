# How to Run:

1.) Due to time constrainsts, the group did not have enough time to find hosting for both the frontend and backend. Instead, we would like to ask the user to downlaod XAMPP, as well as the Apache and PhpMyAdmin services that are availiable through XAMPP

2.) After this is accomplished, download the contents of this respository, extract it, and move the whole folder into the htdocs folder in XAMPP file location 

3.) Boot up PhpMyAdmin in any browser using localhost/phpmyadmin. Go to import, upload the users.sql, and finish importing. We are now ready to open the website

4.) Open a browser of your choice. In the search bar, type localhost/cs.net-cpsc362 and press enter. The site should now boot up and you can start navigating around the site
